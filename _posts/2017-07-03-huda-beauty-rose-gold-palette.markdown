Yes, I gave in to the pressure of Instagram, don’t we all.  I felt like I had enough eyeshadow palettes (is there such a thing?) but I simply could not resist the range of shades and the endless makeup looks all of Instagram seemed to be able to produce from it .

It has always been obvious to me that Huda Kattan is a business woman and a jolly good one too. This has meant that I always took all her advertisement and other beauty bloggers adoration of the palette with a pinch of salt - that is always the best way with these things. After lots of deliberation, I logged into Cult Beauty and actually bought it. It felt like a gamble to buy a palette without swatching it myself or seeing how the colours or the texture sat on my skin tone. I was convinced I had enough ideas to make it work.

When my delivery arrived, I was rather underwhelmed by the packaging. For a palette that costs £56, I would have expected sturdier packaging than just cardboard only because eyeshadows usually last so long that I feel like it is important for them to be in equally lasting packaging.

However, I swatched them and my concerns about packaging were instantly forgotten (you can see why). The palette was such a pleasure to swatch and the pressed glitter shades are incredible. I discovered how much they actually stuck to skin once applied. Being a low maintenance makeup kinda girl this is so exciting to me. I love when I don’t feel like my eyeshadow has disappeared in the middle of the day and I might have to top it up. Although I was slightly concerned swatching the matte shades because they didn’t show up as strongly, it is important to note that sometimes matte shades don’t swatch as well as shimmer shades because they generally have a finer texture. In such cases it is much more useful to actually try the shades as an eyeshadow and that is what I did.  They went on the lid beautifully (over some concealer and setting powder) and the colours really are very pigmented and long lasting.

So what's the catch you ask? Here are some pros and cons so you could decide for yourself.

#### Pros:
* Long lasting
* Highly pigmented
* High quality product at only £3.11 per shade
* Range of shades and textures - both matte and shimmer
* Lots of tutorials available on it
* Good beginner palette
* Universally flattering shades
* Easy to use

#### Cons:
* Difficult to use liquid eyeliner over it - only gel eyeliner really works
* Difficult to take off at the end of the day - if you like makeup that is easy to take off, it’s not for you.
* Lots of fallout - use a tissue while applying or apply before base
* Packaging may not last long because it is cardboard

#### So is it worth £56?
This palette is particularly great if you are a beginner looking for a warm toned palette because the colours show up so well and there are just enough colours to experiment with but not so many that it is intimidating. Also since there are so many tutorials on Instagram and YouTube for this palette, you are unlikely to run out of ideas for a while.

At £3.11 a shade, if you are using all the colours, this palette is an absolute steal. However, if you will likely use only a few of the shades or you only like matte eyeshadows, your money is better spent elsewhere (Urban Decay Basics or just individual eyeshadow shades).

Generally when choosing any eyeshadow palette, it is worth thinking about how many shades you will use/ are flattering on you. Ideally no more than 1/10 of the palette should be shades you won’t use. Get real with yourself and think about whether those colours appeal to you and divide the cost of the palette by the number of shades you love. You’ll soon find yourself an answer.

I have tried a few new looks using this palette and the more I use it the more
I feel like I can do with it. I can see myself taking this palette on long holidays where I don’t want to have to/ can’t carry too much makeup and  be completely satisfied. I might even go as far as to say that this is my favourite palette because of how easy to use and versatile it is. It will be getting a lot of love from me this summer.
