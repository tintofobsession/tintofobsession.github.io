# Deciem Haul

What I bought at the Deciem shop in Old Spitafields Market.

Since there is so much to talk about for these products, I will do a separate post on each product so people can just look at what they're interested in. This is just a brief summary of what I bought, so if you're interested in specific products, watch out for them here or on my Instagram (@tintofobsession).

After finally finishing my end of year exams at university, I was craving a haul. All the late night snacking, sleep deprivation and the stress made my skin. Having to focus solely on work also meant that I was slacking a little on my skincare routine (awful, I know).

I was always using non-rinsing cleansers so, although I didn't wear much makeup, my skin didn't get as much of deep a cleanse as it needed. So I bought some peeling/ regenerative treatments which hopefully will salvage my skin and soon give me a summer glow!

The Ordinary Serum Foundation (2.1 P) - Lightweight Pigment Suspension System with Moderate Coverage. This foundation has been so popular so I obviously had to see what the fuss was all about (SPOILER ALERT: I get what the fuss is all about) - £5.70

The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - 10-Minute Exfoliating Facial for evenings where I really want to get my glow on the next day - £6.30

The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2% - A Mild Lactic Acid Superficial Peeling Formulation for days when I don't need as much help (but I still need some help - you get me) - £5.50

The Ordinary Advanced Retinoid 2% - A Stable Emulsion of Next-Generation Forms of Retinoid because I wanted to try out retinol - £8.00

NIOD LIP BIO-LIPID CONCENTRATE - I heard about this non-invasive lip plumping alternative to lip fillers and I am super intrigued to find out how well it works - £38

So overall I do think I bought a fair few things which did leave a massive dent in my poor student wallet but don't hauls always do? Aren't they always worth it in the end?
